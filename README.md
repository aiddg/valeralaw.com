*(Or, if using GitHub Pages initially: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/` - **Please update this link once your site is deployed and you have the correct URL.**)*

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the structure of the web pages.

* **Vanilla JavaScript:** For interactive elements like the mobile menu, sticky header, and animations.
* **Font Awesome:** For icons (via CDN).
* **Google Fonts:** For typography (`Playfair Display` and `Manrope`).

## Project Structure

The website is structured as a multi-page static site:

* `index.html`: The main homepage.
* `services.html`: Hub page for all legal services offered.
    * `service-*.html`: Individual detailed pages for each practice area (e.g., `service-removal-proceedings.html`, `service-non-immigrant-visas.html`).
* `our-team.html`: Overview of the legal team.
    * `attorney-*.html`: Individual biography pages for each attorney (e.g., `attorney-arnedo-valera.html`).
* `legal-insights.html`: Blog-style page for news, articles, and updates.
    * `article-*.html`: Individual pages for each news item or article (e.g., `article-daca-update.html`).
* `careers.html`: Information on career opportunities.
* `faq.html`: Frequently Asked Questions.
* `client-stories.html`: Testimonials and client success stories.
* `firm-philosophy.html`: The firm's mission, values, and guiding principles.
* `contact.html`: Contact information and form.
* `privacy-policy.html`: Website privacy policy.
* `legal-disclaimer.html`: Website legal disclaimer.

## Local Development & Testing

To test the website locally:
1.  Clone this repository or download the files to your local machine.
2.  Open the project folder in a code editor like Visual Studio Code.
3.  If using VS Code, install the "Live Server" extension (by Ritwick Dey).
4.  Right-click on `index.html` in the VS Code Explorer and select "Open with Live Server".
5.  This will open the website in your default browser, and any saved changes will auto-refresh.

Alternatively, you can simply open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser, but Live Server provides a better development experience with auto-refresh and proper local server behavior.

## Deployment

This static website is suitable for deployment on platforms like:
* **GitHub Pages** (as outlined in previous instructions)
* Netlify
* Vercel
* AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Static Web Apps
* Traditional web hosting providers

If using GitHub Pages, ensure the repository settings are configured to serve from the correct branch (usually `main`) and folder (usually `/root` or `/docs`).

## Important Next Steps & To-Do

This repository contains the foundational structure and design. To complete the website, the following actions are crucial:

* **Replace Placeholder Content:**
    * Update all canonical URLs, Open Graph image URLs, and Twitter image URLs in the `<head>` section of each HTML file.
    * Replace all placeholder images (e.g., `https://placehold.co/...`, hero backgrounds, attorney photos, logos in `images/` folder) with actual, high-quality, and web-optimized images. Ensure all `<img>` tags have descriptive `alt` attributes.
    * Populate all text content:
        * Detailed service descriptions for each `service-*.html` page.
        * Complete biographies for each attorney on their respective `attorney-*.html` pages.
        * Write full content for all articles on `article-*.html` pages.
        * Add genuine client testimonials to `client-stories.html`.
        * Refine content on the `firm-philosophy.html`, `faq.html`, and `careers.html` pages.
        * Update the "Last Updated" dates and any bracketed placeholder text in the `privacy-policy.html` and `legal-disclaimer.html` pages.
* **Legal Review:** Have the `privacy-policy.html` and `legal-disclaimer.html` pages reviewed by a legal professional.
* **Contact Form Implementation:** The contact form in `contact.html` is currently a static HTML form. You will need to integrate a backend solution or a third-party service (e.g., Formspree, Netlify Forms, Getform) to make it functional. Update the `<form action="...">` attribute accordingly.
* **Favicons:** Create and place your `favicon.ico`, `favicon.svg`, and `apple-touch-icon.png` files.
* **Internal Linking:** Double-check all internal navigation links to ensure they point to the correct HTML files and page sections (`#id`).
* **SEO Review:** Conduct thorough keyword research and optimize page titles, meta descriptions, headings, and content for SEO.
* **Testing:** Perform comprehensive testing across different browsers and devices.
